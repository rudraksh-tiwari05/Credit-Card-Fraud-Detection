# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Python.

## Project Structure

- `data.csv`: Credit card transaction data.
- `config.py`: Configuration parameters.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- `models.py`: Implementation of different machine learning models for fraud detection.
- `main.py`: Main script for running the project workflow.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    - Load the credit card transaction data from `data.csv`.
    - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps:
        - Handle missing values.
        - Encode categorical features.
        - Scale numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
    - Create additional features based on existing data to improve model performance.
    - Examples: time-based features, transaction amount percentiles, etc.
3. **Model Training:**
    - Train different machine learning models on the prepared data:
        - Random Forest
        - Isolation Forest
        - Logistic Regression
    - Tune hyperparameters for each model using cross-validation.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Choose the model with the best performance on the validation set.
5. **Visualization:**
    - Visualize the results using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other plots to gain insights into model behavior.

## Running the Project

1. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```
2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

This will execute the entire workflow, train and evaluate the models, and display the results.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning for credit card fraud detection. By implementing various models and analyzing their performance, we can build a robust system to identify fraudulent transactions and protect financial systems.

## Further Enhancements

- Explore additional machine learning algorithms like XGBoost or neural networks.
- Implement anomaly detection techniques for identifying unusual patterns.
- Integrate the model into a real-time fraud detection system.
